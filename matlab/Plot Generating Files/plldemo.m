%% What is a Phase-Locked Loop?
% A phase-locked loop (PLL) is a closed-loop feedback control system that
% generates and outputs a signal in relation to the frequency and phase of
% an input ("reference") signal. A phase-locked loop circuit responds to
% both the frequency and the phase of the input signals, automatically
% raising or lowering the frequency of a controlled oscillator until it is
% matched to the reference in both frequency and phase.
% 
% This type of mechanism is widely used in radio, telecommunications,
% computers and other electronic applications where it is desired to
% stabilize a generated signal or to detect signals in the presence of
% noise. Since an integrated circuit can hold a complete phase-locked loop
% building block, the technique is widely used in modern electronic
% devices, with signal frequencies from a fraction of a cycle per second up
% to many gigahertz.  (Source: wikipedia.org.)


%% A linear Phase Locked Loop in Simulink
% The first step of the demo shows how to model and simulate a linear PLL
% that can track a 1 MHz reference signal.
%
% A classic or linear PLL uses a mixer as a phase detector. This yields a
% DC component that is proportional (but not linear) with the phase
% difference and a component at a frequency that is twice the input
% frequency. A loop filter is used to get rid of the second component. The
% output of the loop filter is fed into a VCO that increases the freqeuncy
% if there is a positive phase difference and that decreases the frequency
% if there is a negative phase difference.
%
% Start with the basic components of a PLL: a Multiply block (Math
% Library), an Analog Filter Design block (Filter Design library in the
% Signal Processing Blockset) and a Voltage Controlled Oscillator
% (Communications Blockset, Components sublibrary in the Synchronization
% library).
%
% Double click on the blocks to show how to set the parameters for each
% block:
%
% The Analog Filter Design block;
%    Design method: butterworth,
%    Filter type: Lowpass,
%    Filter order: 5,
%    Passband edge frequency: 1e6*2*pi.
%
% The VCO block;
%    Quiescent frequency: 1e6,
%    Input sensitivity: 1e5,
%    Initial phase: 0.

open_system('linearpll'); set_param(bdroot,'SimulationCommand', 'update')
sim(bdroot);

%%
% In order to simulate the system, we need a test input and vizualiation.
% To achieve this, add a Sine wave block (Simulink Sources Library) and a
% Scope block (Simulink Sinks library) to the model. Set the parameters of
% the Sine wave to:
%
% Sine Wave block;
%    Frequency: 2*pi*1e6,
%    All other parameters: default.
%
% Add another axes to the Scope block, and connect the two inputs to the
% outputs of the Sine Wave block and the VCO block. Change the simulation
% time to 50 periods (50e-6). Connect a second Scope block to the output of
% the Butterworth filter. Label the block appropriately. Run the
% simulation!

xlabel('Time (\mus)'); set(gcf,'Position', [360   502   560   267]);
ylabel('Voltage (V)');

%%
% To assess the quality of the PLL we are going to look at the spectrum of
% the generated signal. Add a Spectrum Scope block from the Signal
% Processing Sinks library and change it's parameters:
%
% Spectrum Scope parameters;
%    Buffer input: on,
%    Buffer size: 512,
%    Buffer overlap: 256,
%    Window type: Kaiser,
%    Beta: 5,
%    Specify FFT length: off,
%    Number of Spectral averages: 1.

pwelch(log_linearpll.signals(2).values,kaiser(1024,5),512,[],1e8)

%%
% To test how robust the PLL behaves to phase and frequency differences we
% can change the Frequency and Phase offset parameters of the Sine. For
% example, the PLL locks at frequencies up to about 1.05 MHz, but it fails
% to lock at 1.1 MHz. Also, for frequencies other then 1 MHz, the generated
% signal will have a phase offset with respect to the carrier (the reason
% being that the butterworth filter doesn't have a pole at zero (no pure
% integrator). Also note the ripple on the control signal, which is due to
% the second harmonics of the multiplication.

%% A charge-pump PLL with digital Phase-Frequency Detector in Simulink
% Better results can be achieved with a charge pump and a loop filter. The
% charge pump, "pumps" current into a 2nd order loop filter. The branch
% voltage of the loop filter is used as input to the VCO. A digital phase
% frequency detector (PFD) determines whether a positive or negative
% current is pumped into the filter. Phase lead corresponds to a negative
% frequency (output and thus VCO frequency decreases) whereas phase lag
% corresponds to a positive current.
% 
% The PFD is typically a finite state machine that reponds to
% zero-crossings of the input signals. If the reference signal has a
% positive edge first a switch is turned on that pumps a positive
% current into the loop filter, until a positive edge of the VCO signal is
% detected (phase lag).

%%
% We'll start by creating a behavioral model of the PLL. To model the PFD
% we use a Stateflow machine. Create the chart according to the diagram
% below:
%%
% <<pfd.jpg>>
%
%%
% Update the diagram and create input events (Rising Edge) for Ref and Var
% and an output variable for s. To be able to feed the reference signal and
% VCO signal to the Chart, use a Mux block (Simulink routing library)
%
% Implement the charge pump with a Gain block. Set the gain parameter to
% 260e-6 (Ampere). A behavioral model for the loop filter can be created
% with a simple Transfer Fcn block. To set the parameters of this block, we
% need to find the transfer function for the loop filter. Applying the
% Laplace transform to the differential equations yields:
%
%%
% $$ G(s) = \frac{sR_1C_1 + 1}{s^2C_1C_2R_1 + s(C_1 + C_2)} $$
%
% Set the Numerator coefficient of the Transfer Fcn block to [R1*C1, 1], and
% set the Denominator coefficient to [C1*C2*R1, (C1+C2), 0]. Next, adjust
% the loop gain by changing the Input Sensitivity of the VCO to 3e5. Change
% the Initial phase to -pi/2.
%
% Assign values to variables |C1|, |C2| and |R1| in the MATLAB workspace:
%
%  C2 = 17e-12;
%  C1 = 82e-12;
%  R1 = 23e3;
%
% Run the simulation with the Stateflow Chart open to see the animation.
%
% Experiment with the Phase offset and Frequency of the Sine Wave block to
% test the PLL.

open_system('cppll'); set_param(bdroot,'SimulationCommand', 'update')

%% An implementation for the PFD, Charge Pump and Loop filter
% In the previous model we used behaviorable models for the PFD (state
% chart), charge pump (Gain) and loop filter (transfer function). Simulink
% also has the capabilities to simulate an physical implementation for
% these three components.

%%
% Open the model |powerpll| to see an example.

open_system('powerpll'); set_param(bdroot,'SimulationCommand', 'update')

%%
% In this example the phase frequency detector is implemented by two
% flipflops and a NAND gate. The charge pump and loop filter are
% implemented using blocks from the SimPowerSystem blockset. This extension
% to Simulink makes it possible to draw electrical circuits directly in
% Simulink. This eliminates the neccesity to derive differential equations
% and transfer functions and facilitates experimenting with different
% network topologies.
%
% Run the simulation to validate the correct behavior of the PLL.

%% An all digital PLL in Simulink
% PLLs are used more and more in the digital domain, this means that apart
% for the Phase Frequency Detector, also the loop filter and VCO need to be
% to be converted to discrete-time systems.
% The loop filter can be converted from Laplace to the
% z-domain using an appropriate transformation (e.g. Zero-Order Hold,
% Bilinear etc). The VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) need to be
% replaced by an NCO (Numerically Controlled Oscilaator).
%
% Open the model |dpll| to see an example.

open_system('dpll'); set_param(bdroot,'SimulationCommand', 'update')

%%
% The digital filter has been implemented using a Digital Filter block from
% the Signal Processing blockset's Filter Design library. The filter
% coefficients can be reproduced using the following code:
%%
%  G = tf([0 R1*C1, 1],[C1*C2*R1, (C1+C2), 0])
G = tf([0 R1*C1, 1],[C1*C2*R1, (C1+C2), 0])
%%
% |Gd = c2d(G,1e-8)|
Gd = c2d(G,1e-8)

%%
% |a = Gd.den{1}|
a = Gd.den{1}

%%
% |b= Gd.num{1}/Gd.num{1}(2)|
b= Gd.num{1}/Gd.num{1}(2)

%%
% The VCO has been replaced by a subsystem containing a block that converts
% the output of the filter to an incremental value that loops through a
% look-up table of the NCO block. The constant increment value that is
% added corresponds to a frequency of approximately 1MHz. The unit delay
% block is used as a register that makes this system realizable in software
% (in Simulink it breaks the algebraic loop).

open_system('dpll/NCO'); set_param(bdroot,'SimulationCommand', 'update')

%%
% This digital PLL can be automatically converted to floating-point ANSI C
% code using Real-Time Workshop.

%% Converting the digital PLl to fixed-point.
% Many signal processing systems are implemented as hand-held devices (e.g.
% GPS, Mobile phones, multi-media) and need to be cost-effictive. Therefor,
% it is often necessary to convert the system's data-types to fixed-point
% in order to implement the algorithm on either a fixed-point DSP, an FPGA
% or an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit).
%
% Fixed-pont data types however introduce a number of serious challenges
% in the design process:
%
% * Finding optimal word lengths and fraction lengths
% * Writing and understanding integer C-code is cumbersome and error prone
% * Integer C code is hard to debug, pinpointing errors is difficult
% * Translating (sequential) C to (parallel) HDL is a challenge
%
% Simulink avoid these challenges by:
% 1. Seperating the data-types from the algoritms
% 2. Seperating the data-types from the value
%
% Simulink achieves this by providing the following capabilities:
%%
% * Simulink can display the datatype in the block diagram
% * The same blocks that operate on floating-point data also operate on
% fixed-point data. Therefor it's easy to switch.
% * Simulink can log the range of the model's signals, together with
% overflows (if any).
% * Simulink can suggest and apply fraction lengths, based on the ranges of
% a reference simulation.

%%
% We'll use the all digital PLL to show how to convert a floating-point
% Simulink model to fixed-point, using the capabilities mentioned above.

%%
% First, turn on data-type labeling to show the data-types of all the
% signals in the model: Format menu -> Port/Signal Displays -> Port Data
% Types.
%
% All label read "double" which is a 8 byte floating point data type.

%%
% To convert the model, we'll change the datatype of the NCO (we're
% actually changing the data type of the entries in the look-up table).
% Open the NCO subsystem and the NCO block's parameter dialog window.
% Select the second tab to change the block's data types.
%
% Set the output data type to Binary point scaling with a Word length of 16
% bits and a fraction length of 14 bits.
%
% Use a data-type conversion block to set the datatype of the reference
% signal to "Inherit via back propagation".
%
% Update the diagram. Note that the output of the NCO and the Data type
% conversion block have changed to sfix16_n14. This data type has a range
% of [-2 2>. 
%
% To change the output of the Stateflow block, open the Model Explorer from
% Stateflow (View menu -> Model Explorer). Next, select the s data object
% in the middle pane, and change it's data type to a 16 bit signed
% fixed-point number with 14 bits scaling.
%
% Update the diagram, note that the complete model is now fixed-point. Note
% that we didn't have to make any changes to the algorithm itself, or
% replace any of the blocks in the model.
%
% Running the model shows that the PLL doesn't behave correctly.

%% Optimizing fixed-point data types
% To solve the problem, let's use the fixed-point tooling available in
% Simulink fixed-point.
%
%%
% <<fixpttool.jpg>>
%
%%
% 1. To verify that fixed-point data types indeed are the cause for the
% incorrect behavior, run a reference simulation with Data type override
% set to "True doubles". Note that the data types in the model changed to
% "double" again, and that the PLL behaves again correctly!
%
% 2. Run the reference simulation again, but now with Logging mode set to
% Minimum, maximums and overflows. Note the logging of the ranges (no
% overflows due to floating-point data types)
%
% 3. Run an active simulation again, but with Data type override set to
% "Use local settings". Note the overflows in the Loop Filter block
% (Accumulator and Product output).
% 
% 4. Use the autoscaling capabilities of the Fixed-Point Tool to optimize
% the fraction length of the filter's internal variables.
%%
% * Open the Fixed-point tab of the Loop filter block's parameter dialog
% window.
% * Change the Rounding Mode to Nearest
% * Change the data type mode of all the internal variables to Binary point
% scaling. Use a 32 bit word length for the Product output and Accumulator
% and a 16 bit word length for the State and Ouptut.
% * In the Fixed-Point Tool select Auto-scaling using Reference and set a
% 10 Percent safety margin
% Propose and accept the new fraction lengths using the two buttons at the
% bottom of the Dialog View of the Fixed-Point Tool

open_system('dpll_fixpt'); set_param(bdroot,'SimulationCommand', 'update')
sim(bdroot);
%%
% Run the simulation again to see that the overflows have dissapeared and
% that the fixed-point PLL runs as expected!

% Note that the PLL locks to the 1.1 MHz input frequency after about 10
% mu.
